# P2 Dual uSD FAT32 n FLASH FS

A unified filesystem driver for the Parallax Propeller 2 (P2) that provides simultaneous access to both the onboard 16MB FLASH chip and a microSD card through a single cog and a single API.

> **See also:** The two individual drivers are also available as standalone alternatives:
> [P2 FLASH Filesystem](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-FLASH-FS) (Flash-only) and
> [P2 microSD FAT32 Filesystem](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-uSD-FAT32-FS) (SD-only).

## When to Use This Driver

This driver is larger than either standalone driver because it includes both filesystems. There are several ways to use it depending on your project needs:

- **Dual-device product** — Your application uses both SD and Flash at runtime. One cog, one API, both devices always available.

- **Provisioning tool** — Use the SD card to load configuration files, firmware images, or data onto Flash during manufacturing or field setup. Once Flash is populated, ship the product with the smaller [standalone Flash driver](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-FLASH-FS) for a reduced image size.

- **Development and testing** — Use the SD card as a convenient way to get data onto the board during development, then switch to Flash-only for production.

If your product only ever needs one device, the standalone drivers ([Flash-only](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-FLASH-FS), [SD-only](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-uSD-FAT32-FS)) produce smaller binaries.

## Features

- **One worker cog, two devices** — a dedicated cog owns all SPI I/O for both SD and Flash, eliminating bus contention
- **Unified API** — mount, open, read, write, close, and copy files on either device with the same calls
- **Cross-device copy** — copy files between Flash and SD through one driver with `copyFile()`
- **Shared SPI bus management** — automatic bus switching between SD (Mode 0) and Flash (Mode 3) with proper smart pin reconfiguration
- **Multi-cog safety** — hardware lock serializes access from up to 8 cogs
- **Conditional compilation** — `SD_INCLUDE_RAW`, `SD_INCLUDE_REGISTERS`, `SD_INCLUDE_SPEED`, `SD_INCLUDE_DEBUG` for minimal or full builds
- **1,200+ regression tests** across 35 test suites verified on real P2 hardware

## Architecture Overview

The unified driver is built on the SD driver's **worker cog + command dispatch** architecture:

```
 ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
 │  Cog 0   │  │  Cog 1   │  │  Cog N   │   Application cogs
 │ (caller) │  │ (caller) │  │ (caller) │   call public API

              │   Cog      │  owns all SPI pins

     ┌─────▼─────┐     ┌─────▼─────┐

     │  SPI Mode 0│     │  SPI Mode 3│
     └───────────┘     └───────────┘
```

### SPI Bus Sharing

The [SPI Bus State Analysis](DOCs/Analysis/SPI-BUS-STATE-ANALYSIS.md) confirms that bus sharing is safe: each device releases MISO (high-impedance) when its CS goes HIGH. The worker cog is the sole bus owner and switches between devices by:

1. Completing the current device operation (CS HIGH)
2. Settling the bus (SCK to expected idle state)
3. Selecting the target device (CS LOW)

The SD card uses **SPI Mode 0** (CPOL=0, CPHA=0 — clock idles LOW) while the Flash chip ([W25Q128JV](DOCs/Reference/W25Q128JV-210823.pdf)) uses **SPI Mode 3** (CPOL=1, CPHA=1 — clock idles HIGH). The worker cog reconfigures the smart pin clock polarity when switching between devices.

## Hardware Requirements

- Parallax Propeller 2 — [P2-EC](https://www.parallax.com/product/p2-edge-module/) or [P2-EC32MB](https://www.parallax.com/product/p2-edge-module-32mb/)
- microSD card (SDHC or SDXC) — the included format utility can format cards that are not already FAT32

### Default Pin Configuration (P2 Edge)

| Pin | SD Card | Flash |
|-----|---------|-------|
| P58 | MISO (DAT0) | MISO |
| P59 | MOSI (CMD) | MOSI |
| P60 | CS (DAT3) | SCK |
| P61 | SCK (CLK) | CS |

The SD card and Flash chip share the same four SPI pins, with P60 and P61 swapping roles between devices. Pin assignments are configurable at `init()` time.

## Reference Implementations

The `REF-FLASH-uSD/` directory contains the two standalone drivers that served as the development baseline:

| Driver | Description | Original Tests |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| [**Flash FS**](REF-FLASH-uSD/FLASH/) | Wear-leveling filesystem for onboard 16MB FLASH. Circular files, read-modify-write, 4KB blocks, 127-char filenames. | 900+ |
| [**microSD FAT32**](REF-FLASH-uSD/uSD-FAT32/) | Full FAT32 driver with smart pin SPI, streamer DMA, multi-sector transfers. 8.3 filenames, up to 2TB. | 345+ |

Both test suites have been migrated and expanded in the unified driver's [regression test suite](src/regression-tests/).
